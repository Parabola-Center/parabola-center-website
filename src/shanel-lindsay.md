          <p>Founder and President of Ardent, for years I struggled to dose accurately with my medicine. I thought I was doing a good job with my homespun methods until I took my medicine to the lab and realized I could be doing much better. Determined to find a solution, I decided to test all the methods people are currently using.</p>
          <p>I learned It’s virtually impossible to get a full decarb with these conventional appliance. Every method I tried fell short. I commissioned testing with MCR labs on the science to finally solve this grey area in the cannabis world. Armed with this breakthrough research, I developed the NOVA – an inNOVAtive in home device that delivers decarbed marijuana to patients looking for an alternative method to consume.</p>
