  "about": "Parabola Center is a nonpartisan think tank of legal and drug policy experts\ncoming together to protect people, not corporations. Our mission is to provide everyone with the tools\nto be part of the arena where policy gets made.",
  "card_three": "At a certain stage of policymaking, the only stakeholders who can be influential tend to be those who can afford to pay professionals with specialized skills. We created Parabola Center so everyone can have the tools to be influential.",
  "policy": "Read our latest reports and model policies, available for free",
  "card_four": "We’re not funded by multistate cannabis corporations, tobacco companies, or alcohol companies, and we don’t care about their profits. Parabola Center offers people-centered policy alternatives to the big corporate model of industry.",
  "card_one": "We formed the Parabola Center in 2021 when we noticed that the debate about federal marijuana legalization was starting to leave behind the mass movement that made legalization possible. As the conversation has been shifting from “whether” to “how” to legalize, the policy discussions about the most crucial details have also shifted.",
  "card_two": "Organizations backed by police, Big Tobacco, and other big funders lack expertise and credibility on the subject. We decided to help create policies that the millions of people who form the movement for legal cannabis want instead.",
