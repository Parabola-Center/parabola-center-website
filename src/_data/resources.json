      "snippet": "This year, as a majority of voters in both parties continue to favor cannabis legalization, more people in the U.S. reported smoking marijuana than tobacco cigarettes.[](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/politics/marijuana-tobacco-cigarettes-polling-trump-search/index.html) With public support still growing, it's only a matter of time before the federal government finally repeals its prohibition of the drug."

      "snippet": "Much has been written and debated about why the US federal government should or should not legalize cannabis for adults to consume. Now that nineteen states have legalized recreational or adult-use cannabis and thirty-eight states in total have legalized medical cannabis, the conversation has shifted into a nuanced discussion of how to legalize cannabis, not whether to. And the framework that consumers, industry participants, researchers, doctors, patients, and anyone else impacted by the rapidly shifting regulatory structure of state-legal cannabis operate under is not working. Established companies with multibillion-dollar market caps are frozen out of the US financial system. Many prospective small business owners are locked out of checking accounts, getting loans at favorable rates, and the other nuts-and-bolts of creating sustainable businesses. These problems differentially affect minorities and other entrepreneurs from communities harmed by the near half-century old War on Drugs. On top of that, some well-capitalized firms have taken advantage of this patchwork system, creating near-monopolies in some states that have been shown to be detrimental to consumers and the stated goals of the legalization movement."

      "url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3978766",
      "snippet": "As states and local jurisdictions implement new laws legalizing marijuana, many have charged regulators with the worthy goal of remedying the injustices of the drug war, a concept known as social equity. Broadly, social equity falls into a few core policy categories: criminal justice reforms, including automatic expungement of past cannabis offenses; reinvesting a percentage of marijuana tax revenue into the most impacted communities; and—the focus of this paper—creating a cohesive cannabis industry licensing framework with special considerations for people affected by the war on drugs.",

      "attribution": "Shaleen Title",
      "snippet": "It is a crucial and vulnerable moment for the future of the cannabis market. While states are making historic progress creating paths for small businesses and disenfranchised groups, larger companies are expanding, consolidating, and lobbying for licensing rules to create or maintain oligopolies. Federal legalization will only accelerate the power grab already happening with new, larger conglomerates openly expressing interest. Left unchecked, this scramble for market share threatens to undermine public health and safety and undo bold state-level efforts to build an equitable cannabis marketplace. This paper argues for intentionally applying well-developed antitrust principles to federal cannabis reform now, before monopolization of the market takes place, and offers eight concrete policy recommendations."
