  "quote1": "NABCL exists to be an equalizer, promoting an equitable, inclusive and reparative cannabis industry. We’re partnering with Parabola Center because we believe that with our collective power, we can do better than 'business as usual' models that prioritize greed above all else, failing the majority of Americans time and time again. Federal cannabis legalization has the potential to be a game-changer for civil rights, if we are intentional and work together.",
  "quote2": "As the Vermont farmers and neighbors who aim to be known for world-renowned craft cannabis – just like our craft beer, cheese, and maple syrup industries – we know that ending prohibition in a fair and equitable way will take hard work and collaboration. We unite with Parabola Center and many other nonprofits, small businesses, and craft growers in our goal to restore justice to those most harmed by prohibition and provide accessible economic opportunity for all of us.",
  "quote3": "The best way to push for a model of national legalization that protects small cannabis businesses is to listen to the thousands of them who already exist. Our organization believes that social equity, craft, and disadvantaged business operators should be driving the discussion on how to design a national regulatory framework for cannabis. That’s why we listen to them and specifically reject the corporate, pro-monopoly model as well as the Big Money pushing it.  ",
