Once established, it will become increasingly difficult to challenge their power.\\\n\\\nOur crash course **(July 13**) will empower attendees with the knowledge and tools to shape federal legalization in a way that preserves a path for an equitable industry. This event is for everyone who rejects the corporate model of cannabis legalization that concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few. Together, we will build a movement that creates the future for cannabis legalization rooted in the principles of justice, economic empowerment, and fair opportunity for all.\n\n***This crash course is free and open to the public, but registration is required.***\n\n***A rooftop party for crash course attendees will follow from 1-4pm.***\n\n***If you want to go beyond the crash course, we are offering a leadership training (July 14) for a select group of future leaders to sharpen their skills and strategize for the future.
