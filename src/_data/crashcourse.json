  "introContent": "Please join us and our local co-hosts, the Bronx Cannabis Hub, for our third annual Anti-Monopoly Cannabis Policy Crash Course and Leadership Training! This is an opportunity for education and a call to action for those who believe in putting people over profits -- and to be proactive in implementing strong anti-monopoly protections and support for the smaller players at both state and federal levels before corporate interests take hold. Once established, it will become increasingly difficult to challenge their power.\n\nOur crash course will empower attendees with the knowledge and tools to shape federal legalization in a way that preserves a path for an equitable industry. This event is for everyone who rejects the corporate model of cannabis legalization that concentrates wealth and power in the hands of only a few. Together, we will build a movement that creates the future for cannabis legalization rooted in the principles of justice, economic empowerment, and fair opportunity for all.\n\nThis event on October 25 will bring together cannabis activists, policymakers, regulators, growers, retailers, and other industry participants who share the common goal of ensuring that the cannabis industry prioritizes people over profits and stands up to corporate power and greed. The day will consist of a series of presentations from a variety of compelling, experienced speakers from diverse backgrounds and several opportunities to network with other cannabis advocates.\n\n**Morning Session: Leadership Training 9:00am-12:00pm (by application only)**\n\n**Afternoon Session: Crash Course 1:00-5:00pm (registration required, tickets available on a sliding scale)**\n\n***This crash course is open to the public, but registration is required. Speakers will be confirmed closer to the event, and a detailed schedule and FAQ will be available.***",
