  "introContent": "Join us on Saturday, **June 10th from 9:30am to 1:30pm** at the historic **Boston Public Library** for Parabola Center's debut crash course on federal legalization.\n\nIf the national legalization of marijuana is indeed inevitable in America, then it's time to ask the next question: Who gets to write those laws, and who will benefit?\n\nAlready, aspiring weed billionaires and powerful corporations like Amazon and Altria (aka Philip Morris) are hounding Congress to pass bills that would let them be the first to profit from federal legalization— leaving behind small business owners and the many communities that were torn apart by decades of overpolicing.\n\nIt's time to fight back. Parabola Center is bringing together a group of the country's top drug policy experts to dissect the current political landscape and chart a better course toward comprehensive federal cannabis reform that centers all of us, not Wall Street gamblers.\n\nCome ready to hear from small business owners, lifelong advocates, and policymakers at this half-day crash course. You'll leave with a toolkit that will empower you to take action and make a difference in the coming fight to legalize marijuana the right way.\n\n*This event is open to the public. Tickets are $10 to cover the cost of the venue. **All tickets must be purchased in advance and cannot be purchased at the door.** Food is not provided.*\n\n *For group discounts, contact [info@parabolacenter.com](mailto:info@parabolacenter.com)*",
