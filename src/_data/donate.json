  "patreon": "Recurring donations help us plan for the future and keep Parabola Center going strong. Please consider becoming one of our monthly supporters, who receive special benefits on Patreon for sustaining our work. Because we do not accept funds from publicly traded marijuana companies or Big Tobacco, we pay our bills with small donations from people like you.",
  "content": "Your support helps make policy that centers consumers, workers, and small businesses and ensures cannabis industry revenue goes back to the communities most impacted by the War on Drugs. Instead of letting multistate conglomerates hijack the legal marijuana movement, we work to keep the power with the people. By making a tax-exempt donation, you advance our mission to provide everyone with access and expertise to participate in the drug policy arena."
