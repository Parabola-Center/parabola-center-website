  "content" : "Your support helps to create legal frameworks that center consumers, workers, and small businesses and ensures that revenue goes back to the communities that are most impacted by the War on Drugs. Instead of letting multistate conglomerates hijack the legal marijuana movement, we work to keep the power with the people. By making a tax-exempt donation, you advance our mission to provide everyone with access and tools to participate in the drug policy arena."
